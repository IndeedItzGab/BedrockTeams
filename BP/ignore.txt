BedrockTeams V1.1.1
- Implementation of new administrative commands
  - /teamadmin setwarp <team> <warpName> [password]
  - /teamadmin delwarp <team> <warpName> 
  - /teamadmin score <set/add/remove> <team> <amount> 
- Owners can now easily change the enums' name from `messages.js` at the command object section.
- Implementation of usage mistake reply per commands.
- Fixed an issue where some commands won't work because of the changes with usage parameters. Therefore, I am suggesting to update your BedrockTeams starting from this version and above.

BedrockTeams V1.1.21
- Updated module version to support 1.21.100 and above

BedrockTeams V1.1.3
- Implementation of user interface for non-administrators that can be shown by executing `/team` only.

BedrockTeams V1.1.4
- Implementation of user interface for administrators that can be shown by executing `/teamadmin` or `/teama` only.
