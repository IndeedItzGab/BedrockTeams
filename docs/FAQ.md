## How to gain team score?
You may gain score by killing off other's players regardless of the other player if is in a team or not. However, you won't be able to gain score if both of you and the victim were in the same team.

## How to set color to my team?
You'll need to use `/team color <color>` to change the color of your team's name. The parameter cannot be an integer or what we call numbers. Therefore, if you want to set your team's color to "4" for dark red, you'll need to add double quotes before and after the integer. Example: `/team color "5"`.

You can also use words to change the color of your team's name like "dark_red" or "yellow". These are the valid color words:
- "DARK_BLUE" for "§1"
- "DARK_GREEN" for "§2"
- "DARK_AQUA" for "§3"
- "DARK_RED" for "§4"
- "DARK_PURPLE" for "§5"
- "GOLD" for "§6"
- "GRAY" for "§7"
- "DARK_GRAY" for "§8"
- "BLUE" for "§9"
- "GREEN" for "§a"
- "AQUA" for "§b"
- "RED" for "§c"
- "LIGHT_PURPLE" for "§d"
- "YELLOW" for "§e"
- "WHITE" for "§f"

## How to adjust the score of a specific team?
You'll need to use `/teamadmin score \<set|add|remove\> \<team\> \<score\>`. However, you will need to include double qoute before and after of the score for the command to accept it. Therefore, that's how it works. Example Usage: `/teamadmin score set MyTeam "99"` this will set the Myteam's score to 99.
