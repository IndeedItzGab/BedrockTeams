  # BedrockTeams V1.1.1
  - Implementation of new administrative commands
    - /teamadmin setwarp <team> <warpName> [password]
    - /teamadmin delwarp <team> <warpName> 
    - /teamadmin score <set/add/remove> <team> <amount> 
  - Owners can now easily change the enums' name from `messages.js` at the command object section.
  - Implementation of usage mistake reply per commands.
  - Fixed an issue where some commands won't work because of the changes with usage parameters. Therefore, I am suggesting to update your BedrockTeams starting from this version and above.
