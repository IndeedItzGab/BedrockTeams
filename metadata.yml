  # BedrockTeams V1.1.3
  - Improvement with the User Interface making it more interactive.
  - 'Settings' option in the User Interface of the script is now accessible with two new togglable options.
  - Fixed the issue with '/teamadmin chatspy' recieving '[object Object]' instead of the actual message.
  - Added a decent preventive action for the issue that disable the hit action of both player in different teams.
